                                JavaScript
                            </h5>
                            <h6>Blog By: Ayush Tibra</h6>
                            <p>Date: Sep 03, 2021</p>
                            <p class="card-text">At the beginning of JavaScript, there is only one way to declare a
                                variable and that is using the var keyword. With ES6, two new ways to define
                                variables
                                were introduced with let and const. Now, all the major browsers are compatible with
                                the
                                let and const keywords, and most of the developers are using let and const nowadays.

                                The question is, what makes them different from var, which we were using initially?
                                what’s the big idea? Why there are three different ways to define a variable?
                                Let's have a look at the differences between all three scopes of JS:
                                <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>While var and let can be re-declared without being initialized but const should
                                    be
                                    initialized during declaration.</li>
                                <li>They all are hoisted at the top but with var, it is initialized with a default
                                    value, unlike let and const are not initialized.</li>
                                <li>For scoping and re-declaration see the below table for better clarity</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5 class="card-title">The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions</h5>
                            <h6>Blog By: Ashutosh Verma</h6>
                            <p>Date: Sep 03, 2022</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature
                                introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While
                                both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there
                                are certain differences between them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Those functions have differences in the following broader areas:
                                <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Syntax: A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few
                                    lines of code using arrow functions.
                                    Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.</li>
                                <li>Arguments binding: Arguments binding
                                    arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments.
                                    The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn’t define arguments i.e. they do not have
                                    arguments binding.</li>
                                <li>Use of this keyword: Use of this keyword
                                    Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context
                                    means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked.
                                    The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the
                                    regular function’s this behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this”
                                    keyword.
                                    The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle
                                    of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow
                                    parent function which means No matter how or where being executed, this value inside
                                    of an arrow function always equals this value from the outer function.</li>
                                <li>Using a new keyword: Using a new keyword
                                    Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new
                                    keyword.
                                    But, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow
                                    functions can never be used as constructor functions.</li>

                            <p class="card-text">Array functions are something that can help you with any type of
                                manipulation or looping through an array of items in JavaScript. Some of the pre-built
                                functions can have very similar use cases to one another, therefore I have created a
                                list of manipulation functions, with how they look and their use cases.
                                <br>
                                <strong>.forEach()</strong>
                                Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate
                                through array items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for
                                example, an array of objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers.
                                This function takes 1 parameter .forEach(callback). The parameter callback can take up
                                to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element parameter is required, the
                                rest is optional).
                                The parameter element will be used as a variable that stores the current element in the
                                array. Parameter index refers to the element's index in the array and the parameter
                                array points to the array that it was called on.
                                <br>
                                <strong>.map()</strong>
                                Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each element’s content in an
                                array that it is called on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the
                                array that it is called on will stay still. This function is useful for adding a little
                                change to an already existing array, for example adding a property to an object or
                                modifying it. Its construction and use are identical to the previous function .forEach()
                                and both can be used interchangeably.
                                Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter
                                .map(callback). The parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index &
                                array (but only the element parameter is required, the rest is optional).
                                <br>
                                <strong>.filter()</strong>
                                Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the
                                assigned condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal
                                to a certain integer, or by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object
                                with certain property that is equal to something. Both examples have a very frequent use
                                as a developer.
                                This function returns an array of found results, if any, even if only 1 match is found.
                                If a function does not find any match, it simply returns an empty array.
                                Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter
                                .filter(callback). The parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index &
                                array (but only the element parameter is required, the rest is optional).
                                <br>
                                <strong>.find()</strong>
                                Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one
                                small detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more
                                than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.
                                Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter
                                .find(callback). The parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index &
                                array (but only the element parameter is required, the rest is optional).

                            </h5>
                            <h6>Blog By: John Au-Yeung</h6>

                            <p class="card-text">Template strings, also known as template literals are literals
                                delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string
                                interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged
                                templates.

                                Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are
                                used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of
                                placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be
                                used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different
                                parts of the template literal.
                                <br>
                                Template literals can do everything that regular strings can, so you could possibly
                                replace all strings in your project with them and have the same functionality. However,
                                the most common convention in codebases is to only use template literals when using the
                                additional capabilities of template literals, and consistently using the single or
                                double quotes for all other simple strings. Following this standard will make your code
                                easier to read if examined by another developer.

                                Now that you’ve seen how to declare strings with single quotes, double quotes, and
                                backticks, you can move on to the first advantage of template literals: writing
